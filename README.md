# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

Some ideas for improving the project would be to add vendor prefixes to the css for cross-browser compatibility and having the video loop so as to give a preview to the viewer and help increase clicks and interest. I would also add a parallax scrolling effect to engage the customer with the information and increase sales conversion rates.
